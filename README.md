# First Project => **Bookbot**

Project for the learn Python course

Welcome to my first project! 
I'm going to build "Book Bot" - a Python program that can analyze an entire book and print out an interesting statistical report.

---Let's start it---
1. Dowload this project.
2. I have already a frankenstein.txt in book directory. If you want to change, you can use your book(.txt).
3. run ```python main.py``` in terminal.
